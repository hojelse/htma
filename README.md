## Todo

- [ ] 1. Make stepper motor point at some angle, controlled from software
  - [x] Picture of circuit (diagram and physical)
  - [ ] Arduino code
  - [ ] Print paper with 360 degrees
  - [ ] Demo video and pictures
- [ ] 2. Make big arm, with geared connection, with software controlled range of motion in 180deg
  - [ ] Components models in fusion
    - [ ] Base with motor mount
    - [ ] Big arm
    - [ ] Gears
    - [ ] Ball bearing
    - [ ] Stepper motor
  - [ ] Create fusion assembly
  - [ ] Update arduino code (with 180 deg limit on range of motion)
  - [ ] Print paper with 180 degrees
  - [ ] Demo video and pictures
- [ ] 3. Make medium arm, with timing belt, and linear interpolation in 2D
  - [ ] Percure timing belt, another stepper motor, and A4988 controller board
  - [ ] Components models in fusion
    - [ ] Medium arm
    - [ ] Other stepper motor (if different size)
    - [ ] Belt gearing
